# FastFoodVisualization

I created some visualizations on data I found online to show how I analyzed fast food chains including financial data. I believe that this data can show how I not only analyze data, but can turn this data into information to help show people while helping people learn how to design their business and management.  The example I created was dashboards and visualizations using Tableau. The overall dataset shows the top 50 fast food chains in the United States along with their food categorization and additional financial cuts of data. With the data provided I created additional analytical columns and created an analysis showing a comparison between the owners (franchise owned versus company owned). When creating a dashboard, I like to create quick visualizations to show trends and outliers with the combination of data matrices to easily download. These dashboards include different filters to dynamically pivot and drill down the full dataset into customized information.
